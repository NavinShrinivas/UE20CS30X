- Task 1 | Setting up linux and hadoop :
    - First is to get a VM running, but I'm using a docker instead. I have the docker compose and Dockerfile, feel free to use em... They are barebones debain with persist vol.
    - On this form of linux you have, get a hadoop install running. All the check and scripts they ask you to run should work on docker just fine. If you did everything right that is.
- Task 2 | MapRedduce 
    - Using the large json dump along with the online portal, we write mapper and reducer file.
- Task 3 | Hive Commands
- Task 4 | Googles Page rank Algorithm
- Task 5 | Kafka and Spark

After this, we were asked to create yet another map reducer frame work or another kafka!
